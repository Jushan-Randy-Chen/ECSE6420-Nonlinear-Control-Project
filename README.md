### This is the final project for ECSE 6420 -- Nonlinear Control at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Spring 2025 semester. 

#### In our project we apply feedback linearization, a nonlinear control method, for airfoil pitch stabilization in unsteady airflow. We built a Simulink model from scratch to simulate the closed-loop dynamics.
